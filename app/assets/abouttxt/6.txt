On November 20, 2012, she was elected by her colleagues as Chairwoman of the County Commission where she will serve a two-year term.

Commissioner Sosa was born in Camaguey, Cuba.

Commissioner Sosa has been an educator for more than 30 years and is currently a teacher-trainer for Miami-Dade County Public Schools.

Prior to joining Miami-Dade County, Commissioner Sosa served as mayor of the City of West Miami from 1994 to 2001 where her leadership resulted in the city's recovery from a 52% budget deficit, thus removing it from the Governor's Emergency List. During her tenure, she was able to secure more than $5 million in grants for the City for capital improvement projects  as well as improvements to its drainage and parks systems.
